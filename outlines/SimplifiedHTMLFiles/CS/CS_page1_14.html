  Course Description
</h2>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>CS 136:</div>
<p>This course builds on the techniques and patterns learned in CS135 while making the transition to use an imperative language. It introduces the design and analysis of algorithms, the management of information, and the programming mechanisms and methodologies required in implementations. Topics discussed include iterative and recursive sorting algorithms; lists, stacks, queues, trees, and their application; abstract data types and their implementations.</p>

<p>Notes:</p><ul><li>You must pass both the Assignments portion and the weighted exam (Midterm Exam/Assessment, Final Exam/Assessment) portions of the course in order to pass the course.</li><li><strong>Not all assignments are weighted equally.</strong><ul><li>Assignment 0 does not contribute to the final grade but must be completed to gain any course credit.</li><li>Asignments 1 to 5 are regular-weight assignments (2.5% each).</li><li>Assignments 6 and 7 are double-weighted (5% each).</li><li>Code style grade (for assignments 5 to 7) counts as an extra regular-weight assignment (2.5%)</li></ul></li><li>Students are expected to attend the lecture section in which they are registered; failing to do so will result in a loss of in-class participation points.  We are considering the 75% sessions with your highest session participation mark for your overall Class Participation component mark. This accounts for missed classes; no other accommodation will be given.</li><li>If you submit an assessment exemption request in the form of a verification of absence/illness form or through accessibility services, please contact the course staff to receive confirmation of exemption.  Refer to the course on Open edX for information on how to inform us of an exemption request.</li><li>No student can be exempted from more than 7.5% of the assignment grade. To elaborate, if a student has been excused from 2 regular-weight assignments (2.5% each), they cannot be excused from a double-weighted assignment (5%), as that exceeds the 7.5% threshold.</li><li>If in-person exams cannot be held then they will be held online (if possible).  An online exam will have half of its weight moved to the assignment component.<ul><li>See the second table for an example of what this would look like if both exams are moved online.</li></ul></li><li>If an online exam is not possible (e.g. due to not having enough time to switch format) then that exam will be cancelled.  Half of the weight will be moved to the assignment component, and the other half will be moved to the other exam.</li></ul><p> </p>

<h3>
  Assignment Screening
</h3>
<p>
  Measure of Software Similarities (MOSS) is used in this course as a means of comparing students' assignments to ensure academic integrity. We will report suspicious activity, and penalties for plagiarism/cheating are severe. Please read the available information about academic integrity very carefully.  Discipline cases involving any automated marking system such as Marmoset or MarkUs include, but are not limited to, printing or returning values in order to match expected test results rather than making an actual reasonable attempt to solve the problem as required in the assignment question specification.
</p>

<h2>
  Administrative Policy
</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Assignment Questions</strong>: Assignment questions will be colour-coded as either "black" or "gold" to indicate if collaboration is permitted.  For "black" questions, moderate collaboration is permitted. You may discuss assignment strategies openly with others (including online) but you may not share your code with another individual in the class. You may also search the Internet or use GenAI for strategies and code examples. Any form of collaboration, including discussion must be stated explicitly in your submissions. Not properly stating collaboration on your assignment is considered to be a violation of academic integrity.  For "gold" questions, no collaboration is permitted. This also implies no collaboration on test cases. All work is to be done individually. You are not allowed to discuss solution ideas, implementation details, or code. Only clarification on what an assignment question is asking is permitted. All work submitted must be entirely your own. If you find yourself stuck, contact an ISA or instructor or IA for additional help, instead of getting the solution from someone else. You may also ask on the discussion forums in a private message. When trying to deal with difficulties, do not copy from the book or any Web sources, unless explicitly authorized to do so.  The penalty for plagiarism is an assigned mark of zero on the assignment question or test and a deduction of five marks from the final course grade, consistent with the School of Computer Science and Faculty of Mathematics policy. In addition, a letter detailing the offence is sent to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies, meaning that subsequent offences will carry more severe penalties, up to suspension or expulsion. To avoid inadvertently incurring this penalty, do not copy work from anyone or any place.</p><p><strong>Remarking Policy</strong>: Submit a remark request form, which is available on the course edX, to your course ISA to request a remark on your assignments.</p><p><strong>Missed Assessments</strong>: Assignments are a key component of this course, and you are expected to complete them all. Exceptions may be granted in the case of illness or other extenuating circumstances (if you need such an exception, ask your ISC, and be aware that you may be required to provide documentation). However, no more than 7.5% of the course grade reserved for assignments may be excluded from the final grade, regardless of your circumstances. If your circumstances are such that that level of accommodation is insufficient, consult an academic advisor to discuss your options.  With a valid Verification of Illness Form (VIF), the weight of the assignment you missed may be shifted to the rest of your assignments; and for the midterm, the weight may be shifted to your final assessment.  With a valid VIF, a missed final assessment results in an INC for your final grade; and your final grade will be calculated when you are next able to write a final assessment.  Your grade will then be calculated using your previous assignment, participation and midterm mark and using the current weighting used from this semester.  If you are in any of these cases, please contact the coordinator.</p><p><strong>Use of the Discussion Forums</strong>: Use the discussion forums for general questions about assignments. Do not discuss implementation details for assignments (such as code particulars) or concrete assignment solutions publicly.  Do not discuss anything about the midterm or the final assessment on the discussion forums (except privately to the instructors).</p><p><strong>Use of Microsoft Teams</strong>: The use of Microsoft Teams is exclusive to office hours, question and answer sessions, and private appointments; it should be limited to the specific channel and time slot.  You should not post nor discuss anything relating to the assignments with others on Microsoft Teams, and specific questions should not be posted directly on Teams.  If you have a question, use the discussion forums if applicable or email the appropriate person. The student group on Teams is only monitored during specified office hours or question and answer sessions in the specific channel.</p><p><strong>Mental Health Support</strong>: The Faculty of Math encourages students to seek out mental health support if needed.</p><ul><li>On-campus Resources:<ul><li>Campus Wellness <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/">https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/</a></li><li>Counselling Services: <a href="counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca">counselling.services@uwaterloo.ca</a> 519-888-4567 ext 32655</li><li>MATES: one-to-one peer support program offered by Waterloo Undergraduate Student Association (WUSA) and Counselling Services: <a href="mailto:mates@wusa.ca">mates@wusa.ca</a></li><li>Health Services: located across the creek from the Student Life Centre, 519-888-4096.</li></ul></li><li>Off-campus Resources:<ul><li>Good2Talk (24/7): Free confidential help line for post-secondary students.

Please be aware that generative AI is known to falsify references to other work and may fabricate facts and inaccurately express ideas. GenAI generates content based on the input of other human authors and may therefore contain inaccuracies or reflect biases. </p><p>In addition, you should be aware that the legal/copyright status of generative AI inputs and outputs is unclear. Exercise caution when using large portions of content from AI sources, especially images. More information is available from the Copyright Advisory Committee: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence"><u>https://uwaterloo.ca/copyright-at-waterloo/teaching/generative-artificial-intelligence</u></a> </p><p>You are accountable for the content and accuracy of all work you submit in this class, including any supported by generative AI.</p><p><strong>Territorial Acknowledgement: </strong>The University of Waterloo acknowledges that much of our work takes place on the traditional territory of the Neutral, Anishinaabeg, and Haudenosaunee peoples.

<p><strong>Academic integrity</strong>: In order to maintain a culture of academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.]</p>
<p><strong>Grievance: </strong>A student who believes that a decision affecting some aspect of their university life has been unfair or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a grievance. Read <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>. When in doubt, please be certain to contact the department’s administrative assistant who will provide further assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Discipline: </strong>A student is expected to know what constitutes academic integrity to avoid committing an academic offence, and to take responsibility for their actions. [Check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/academic-integrity/">the Office of Academic Integrity</a> for more information.] A student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offence, or who needs help in learning how to avoid offences (e.g., plagiarism, cheating) or about “rules” for group work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course instructor, academic advisor, or the undergraduate associate dean. For information on categories of offences and types of penalties, students should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a>. For typical penalties, check <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/guidelines/guidelines-assessment-penalties">Guidelines for the Assessment of Penalties</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Appeals: </strong>A decision made or penalty imposed under <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-70">Policy 70, Student Petitions and Grievances</a> (other than a petition) or <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-71">Policy 71, Student Discipline</a> may be appealed if there is a ground. A student who believes they have a ground for an appeal should refer to <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/secretariat/policies-procedures-guidelines/policy-72">Policy 72, Student Appeals</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note for students with disabilities: </strong><a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/accessability-services/">AccessAbility Services</a>, located in Needles Hall, Room 1401, collaborates with all academic departments to arrange appropriate accommodations for students with disabilities without compromising the academic integrity of the curriculum. If you require academic accommodations to lessen the impact of your disability, please register with AccessAbility Services at the beginning of each academic term.</p>
<p><strong>Turnitin.com: </strong>Text matching software (Turnitin®) may be used to screen assignments in this course. Turnitin® is used to verify that all materials and sources in assignments are documented. Students' submissions are stored on a U.S. server, therefore students must be given an alternative (e.g., scaffolded assignment or annotated bibliography), if they are concerned about their privacy and/or security. Students will be given due notice, in the first week of the term and/or at the time assignment details are provided, about arrangements and alternatives for the use of Turnitin in this course.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to notify the instructor if they, in the first week of term or at the time assignment details are provided, wish to submit alternate assignment.</p>
